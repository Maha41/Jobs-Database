khourycollege,02/10/2019 6:19,72,2,It's been a great week guys!! Thank you for having me here  and for listening to me rant on the stories :) thanks to everyone who showed the interest in the polls and had questions about Seattle. .
khourycollege,02/05/2019 18:11,48,0,Good morning guys! So like I told you  it was a snow day yesterday and Seattle is still recovering from it and so we had an off from campus today too. Tuesdays are my most hectic day of the week  thanks to a lecture in Computer Systems  I tutor some students in Python followed by actually holding Office Hours for a course that I am TAing. I end the day with TAing during the lecture of the same class from 6pm - 9pm. So today  it feels like I'm having an extended long weekend - and I'm making full use of it to catch up on my technical reading. .
