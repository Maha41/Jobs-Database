"Director, Align Program-MS in Computer Science, Boston",FTFR001243,Khoury College of Computer Sciences,,Boston Main Campus,Full Time,4,03/20/2019,"The Director of Align-Boston will provide leadership and academic oversight for the ALIGN Master’s in Computer Science at Northeastern’s main campus in Boston.
About the Align Program
Align’s mission is to close America’s tech diversity gap. To do so, we are reinventing Computer Science post-graduate education by scaling an innovative Experiential Master’s in Computer Science for Non-Computer Science Majors. Scaling Align is a primary initiative of Northeastern University’s Khoury College of Computer Sciences.
The Challenge
Women represent more than 50% of all bachelor’s degree recipients but only 18% of CS graduates. Similarly, underrepresented minorities represent 25% of all bachelor’s degree recipients but just 10% of CS graduates. By closing these gaps, we will not only address a major economic issue, but also a profound issue of social equity and inclusion.
Our Solution
The Align MS in CS is an onramp designed to bring a diversity of race, gender and thought into America’s tech workforce. It differs from other MS in CS programs in several key ways: 
•	It is intended specifically for students who did not earn an undergraduate degree in CS
•	It begins with two semesters of Align academic bridge courses (“the bridge”) to prepare students for Master’s level work
•	It emphasizes work experience, leveraging Northeastern’s famous co-op program and network of 400+ corporate partners
•	It is taught at night and year-round so students can finish in 2-2.5 years
•	It is offered at tech hubs across the country (Boston, Charlotte, Seattle, San Francisco, and Silicon Valley, with more locations to come)
•	It seeks to amplify impact by collaborating with other higher ed institutions to scale this solution
Our pilot to date has demonstrated strong employment outcomes, with graduates landing top jobs and leading firms and earning average salaries of $100,000 or more. Unlike code academies, our graduates are prepared for tech leadership career paths. Unlike undergraduate programs, the program takes 2- 2.5 years to complete. And, most importantly, half of our graduates will be women and 25% will be underrepresented minorities.
The Director will teach in the program  and will have the opportunity to recruit full- and part-time faculty to teach Align-specific courses as well as to enrich course offerings in Computer Science at all levels. The ideal candidate demonstrates a commitment to broadening participation and increasing diversity in computer science and in higher education.  A bonus would be experience conducting research in CS education with a demonstrated track record of publications in venues such as ICER, SIGCSE, and Learning @ Scale.

In addition, s/he is expected to collaborate with and learn from faculty and administration in all of the Khoury College campuses (currently Boston, Seattle, Charlotte, and San Francisco/Silicon Valley) on curriculum and faculty development, student recruitment, student experience, and staffing. Overall, the director acts as the primary coordinator and ambassador for the Align program in Boston.
The Director must be a professional who has the ability to work with Northeastern faculty and staff to sustain and further develop the Align program, enjoys interacting with students, and has the energy and enthusiasm to be part of a team that is growing something unique in higher education.","Candidates will be considered from all areas in Computer and Information Science.

Qualitative Research Manager,STFR005331,College of Social Sciences and Humanities,Not Applicable,Boston Main Campus,Full Time,11,03/12/2019,"The Center for Crime and Community Resilience (CCR) at Northeastern University seeks a Qualitative Research Manager to assist with a research project related to the opioid epidemic in Massachusetts. The ideal candidate for this position will have considerable experience conducting, transcribing, coding, analyzing, and storing qualitative research as well as experience working with community and law enforcement partners, and have the ability to work with diverse groups of people in different contexts. During the course of the project, the Qualitative Research Manager will have the opportunity to work with leading scholars around issues of community and criminal justice, including Dr. Rod Brunson and Dr. Anthony Braga. This position is based at Northeastern University in Boston, is eligible for Northeastern benefits, and will report to CCR Director Anthony Braga.
We see this as one of the most important projects the CCR is currently working on, and one that will give the Research Manager the ability to work with a wide range of partners on an issue of the highest policy importance. The opioid epidemic in Massachusetts (and the U.S. more broadly) shows no sign of subsiding; there is growing awareness among policymakers that expanding treatment alone may not be enough to curtail the epidemic. At the same time, policymakers have been reluctant to use criminal justice as part of the strategy to fight the epidemic—in part because of valid concerns that many criminal justice interventions can have harmful side effects that fall particularly heavily on disadvantaged communities.
To overcome this policy roadblock, better research and data may not just be helpful, but necessary. State and local enforcement agencies are willing to engage and try innovative practices, but policymakers will not be willing to embrace solutions unless those solutions are supported by rigorous studies—evidence that demonstrates strong benefits with minimal harmful side-effects. Through this project, we will work directly with federal, state, and local enforcement government agencies to design and implement the research that will be necessary to develop new enforcement strategies on the opioid crisis. In all cases, these strategies are focused on reducing harm: preventing overdose deaths, encouraging people suffering from OUD to seek treatment, and mitigating the harms to communities done by drug markets.
The project will follow two connected sets of activities. First, we convene a variety of federal, state and local partners—from both law enforcement and public health—in the cities of Boston, Lawrence, and Woburn. These partners meet in working groups that bridge disciplines (including law, criminology and public health) to discuss shared challenges and to identify the most pressing open questions and areas for exploration. Synthesis of the working group activities will guide the second set of activities: problem analysis research that can inform and identify policy interventions.
The Qualitative Research Manager will lead the collection of qualitative data across the three sites. This person will be responsible for working with key neighborhood organizations, community liaisons, and addiction treatment service providers to recruit willing subjects for interviews. The Qualitative Research Manager will spend considerable amounts of on-the-ground time in the three sites to develop relationships with subjects and acquire deep understanding of opioid market settings and broader neighborhood dynamics. She/he will also be responsible for running focus groups and capturing qualitative insights during working group meetings. This person will also supervise a qualitative PhD student research assistant in the collection of qualitative data.
This position is grant-funded and runs until 8/31/20 with the possibility of extension based on funding availability.","The ideal candidate will have:
Education: At least a bachelor’s degree, with significant training in criminology, public policy, public health, or qualitative methods of program evaluation. Master’s degree preferred.
Experience: Experience working with community groups, particularly with groups such as law enforcement, addiction treatment providers, and disadvantaged or vulnerable populations.
Skills: Mastery of the overall qualitative research process including logistics, design, execution, and data analysis.
Organization: The ability to organize data collection/storage activities and take systematic notes during focus group sessions.
Ability to travel locally: This position will involve some travel between Boston, Woburn and Lawrence, Massachusetts.",This position is grant-funded and runs until 8/31/20 with the possibility of extension based on funding availability.

Professor of the Practice and Global Director of the Align Program,FTFR001217,Khoury College of Computer Sciences,Not Applicable,Boston Main Campus,Full Time,4,02/06/2019,"Align’s mission is to close America’s tech diversity gap. To do so, we are reinventing Computer Science post-graduate education by scaling an innovative experiential masters in computer science for non-computer science majors. Scaling Align is a priority initiative of Northeastern University’s Khoury College of Computer Sciences.
The Challenge
Women represent more than 50% of all bachelor’s degree recipients but only 18% of CS graduates. Similarly, underrepresented minorities represent 25% of all bachelor’s degree recipients but just 10% of CS graduates. If we can work towards closing these gaps, we will not only address a major economic challenge, but also a profound issue of social equity and inclusion.
Our Solution
The Align MS in CS is an onramp designed to bring a diversity of race, gender and thought into America’s tech workforce. It differs from other MS in CS programs in several key ways: 
•	It is intended specifically for students who did not earn an undergraduate degree in CS.
•	It begins with two semesters of Align academic bridge courses (“the bridge”) to prepare students for Master’s level work.
•	It emphasizes work experience, leveraging Northeastern’s famous co-op program  and a network of 400+ corporate partners in tech.
•	It is taught at night and year-round so students can finish in 2-2.5 years,
•	It is offered at tech hubs across the country (Boston, Charlotte, Seattle, San Francisco, and Silicon Valley, with more locations to come),
•	It seeks to amplify impact by collaborating with other higher ed institutions to scale this solution.
Our pilot to date has demonstrated strong employment outcomes, with graduates landing top jobs and leading firms and earning average salaries of $100,000 or more. Unlike code academies, our graduates are prepared for tech leadership career paths. Unlike undergraduate programs, the program takes 2-2.5 years to complete. And, most importantly, half of our graduates will be women and 25% will be underrepresented minorities.","•	Candidates must hold a PhD in Computer Science or related field and have 15 years of experience in academia
•	Candidates must have experience in the introductory sequence for computer science majors both in teaching and curricular development
•	Candidates must have a distinguished career in the computing field that would qualify for the title of Professor of the Practice.
•	Expertise in applying machine learning to assess and drive outcomes is a plus but not required.",

About the Align Program: Align’s mission is to close America’s tech diversity gap. To do so, we are reinventing Computer Science post-graduate education by scaling an innovative Experiential Masters in Computer Science for Non-Computer Science Majors. Scaling Align is a primary initiative of Northeastern University’s Khoury College of Computer Sciences.
The Challenge
Women represent more than 50% of all bachelor’s degree recipients but only 18% of CS graduates. Similarly, underrepresented minorities represent 25% of all bachelor’s degree recipients but just 10% of CS graduates. By closing these gaps, we will not only address a major economic issue, but also a profound issue of social equity and inclusion.
Our Solution
The Align MS in CS program differs from typical MS in CS programs in several key ways. It is:
• Designed for students who did not earn an undergraduate degree in CS  
• Coupled with Northeastern’s famous co-op program to provide a paid 6-8 month work experience in one of the college’s network of 500+ corporate partners  
• Taught at night year-round so students can keep up with other commitments and finish in 2.5 years 
• Offered locally at tech hubs across the country:  Boston, Charlotte, San Francisco (opened in January 2019), Seattle, and Silicon Valley.

Unlike code academies, our graduates are prepared for tech leadership career paths. Unlike undergraduate programs, the program takes only 2.5 years to complete. Most importantly, more than half of our graduates will be women and more than 25% will be underrepresented minorities. It is the ideal onramp for bringing a diversity of race, gender and thought to America’s tech workforce. Across all campuses we currently have 560 students in the Align MS in CS, with Seattle being the Align program’s original location.

"Lecturer/Asst/Assoc/Full Teaching Professor-Professional Master’s programs including the Align MS in CS, Charlotte, NC",FTFR000917,Khoury College of Computer Sciences,,Charlotte Campus,Part Time,4,02/07/2019,"The Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University invites applications for positions at the rank of Lecturer/Assistant Teaching Professor/Associate Teaching Professor/Full Teaching Professor in the Professional Masters Programs and in the Align Program at Northeastern’s Charlotte campus beginning in Summer 2019 and September 2019.
We are seeking highly-motivated individuals committed to excellence in teaching. Full-time appointments at all ranks are renewable, career-focused non-tenure-track positions with responsibilities in teaching and service. Opportunities for research and scholarship are possible with course releases to make time for scholarship. Primary responsibilities include teaching graduate courses at the MS-level and in the Align Program (see below for a description). We are searching across all areas of computer and data science. Classes primarily meet in the evening and are small, with 10-40 students in a section. Faculty are supported with TAs and graders. The successful candidate will create course content and materials, and collaborate closely with colleagues across all Northeastern University campuses (Boston, Charlotte, San Francisco, Seattle and Silicon Valley). Student advising and service to the college and university are an integral component of the position. Northeastern University is a global university recognized by our renowned co-op program and our focus on experiential learning.
About the Align Program: Align’s mission is to close America’s tech diversity gap. To do so, we are reinventing Computer Science post-graduate education by scaling an innovative Experiential Masters in Computer Science for Non-Computer Science Majors. Scaling Align is a primary initiative of Northeastern University’s Khoury College of Computer Sciences.
The Challenge
Women represent more than 50% of all bachelor’s degree recipients but only 18% of CS graduates. Similarly, underrepresented minorities represent 25% of all bachelor’s degree recipients but just 10% of CS graduates. By closing these gaps, we will not only address a major economic issue, but also a profound issue of social equity and inclusion.
Our Solution
The Align MS in CS program differs from typical MS in CS programs in several key ways. It is:
• Designed for students who did not earn an undergraduate degree in CS  
• Coupled with Northeastern’s famous co-op program to provide a paid 6-8 month work experience in one of the college’s network of 500+ corporate partners  
• Taught at night year-round so students can keep up with other commitments and finish in 2.5 years 
• Offered locally at tech hubs across the country:  Boston, Charlotte, San Francisco (opened in January 2019), Seattle, and Silicon Valley.
Our 5 year pilot to date has already demonstrated a graduation rate of 91%, with 100% employment and average salaries exceeding $100,000. Unlike code academies, our graduates are prepared for tech leadership career paths. Unlike undergraduate programs, the program takes only 2.5 years to complete. Most importantly, more than half of our graduates will be women and more than 25% will be underrepresented minorities. It is the ideal onramp for bringing a diversity of race, gender and thought to America’s tech workforce. Across all campuses we currently have 560 students in the Align MS in CS, with Charlotte being our most recent new location.  Northeastern’s Charlotte campus, in the heart of Charlotte, is located at the corner of Trade and Tyron Streets in Uptown. In January 2018  and Fall 2018 we welcomed our first and second cohort of Align students to Charlotte, respectively.  We are building a third robust cohort for Spring of 2019 and will continue to scale the program thereafter. Note that classes are given in the evening and run year round. Our plan is to grow the Charlotte campus to serve over 200 students per year.
